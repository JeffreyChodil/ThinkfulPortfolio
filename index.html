   <h2>About Jeffrey Chodil</h2>
   <p>I am a computer programmer in training located in Tampa, Florida. Before COVID-19, I worked as a professional Classical pianist. 
		 Due to the pandemic's dire economic impact on the arts, the time has come to make a career shift. As I embark on this new direction, 
		 I look forward to new experiences and new opportunities. Coming out of this strange and wild year, I hope to turn the page in 2021 
		 and relocate to California for the next chapter of my life!</p>

  <div>
		<p>Though I may be new to coding, I am excited and optimistic about this new venture. In nearly 30 years of music experience, I have
		developed valuable skills as a performer, collaborator, creator, researcher, and educator. Some of the skills which I believe will aid me
		as a programmer include:</p>

		<ul>
		 <li>Focus and self-discipline</li>
		 <li>Goal- and detail-oriented work ethic</li>
		 <li>Creativity and lateral thinking for out-of-the-box problem solving</li>
		 <li>Practice in breaking down complicated problems to visualize and find logical and pragmatic solutions</li>
		 <li>Being able to learn quickly and efficiently</li>
		 <li>Ability to collaborate with others as leader, partner, and supporter</li>
		 <li>Confidence presenting/performing in front of large groups</li>
		 <li>Ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and succinctly</li>
		 <!-- I can explain concepts as if explaining to a 5-year-old because I've taught 5-year-old piano students for a living! -->
		 <li>The patience and diligence which comes from teaching young children</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Did you know?</h2>
		<p>My training as a Classical pianist has actually <strong>physically</strong> changed my brain! According to 
		<a href="https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/news/bimanual-labor-neuroscience-piano-playing" target="_blank">neuroscientists</a>, 
		I have <b>more</b> connections between my right and left hemispheres. Thinking colloquially about how one 
		side of the brain tends to be associated with math and logic, while the other side tends to have more visual and 
		artistic associations, bridging that dichotomy just might give me an advantage combining the different facets of 
		web development!</p>

		<h2>Onwards and Upwards!</h2>
		<p>I began my new journey learning the basics of:</p>

		<!-- In truth, the use of an ordered list here is to satisfy the requirements for the portfolio assignment. -->
		<ol>
		 <li>JavaScript</li>
		 <li>HTML</li>
		 <li>CSS</li>
		</ol>

		<p>As I continue to learn, I look forward to applying my new skills!</p>
